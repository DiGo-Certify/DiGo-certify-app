With the advent of the digital era, the management of academic records presents substantial challenges. The prevalence of forged certificates and the absence of a universally trusted system for issuing and verifying academic credentials contribute to significant issues within the education sector. Traditionally, academic records are managed by individual institutions through their proprietary systems, making verification by external stakeholders cumbersome. This lack of transparency and accessibility complicates the process of confirming the authenticity of academic accomplishments, leading to potential mistrust and inefficiencies.

The inability to effectively verify academic credentials has facilitated the rise of degree mills~\cite{saleh2020blockchain}, which produce counterfeit certifications. These fraudulent activities undermine the credibility of genuine academic institutions and compromise the value of legitimate degrees~\cite{muzammil2010corrupt}. Furthermore, the current systems are susceptible to unauthorized alterations and inaccuracies, further eroding trust in academic records.

To address these challenges, the integration of blockchain technology presents a promising solution. Blockchain offers a decentralized and tamper-proof method for recording and verifying academic credentials. By leveraging smart contracts, academic records can be securely issued, stored, and verified on a blockchain. This approach ensures transparency, reduces the risk of fraud, and simplifies the verification process for stakeholders.

The SCAR project represents an innovative application of blockchain technology in the education sector. This system aims to streamline the issuance and verification of academic certificates, ensuring that all records are securely stored and easily accessible for verification. The use of smart contracts in the DiGo Certify App automates the process of certificate issuance and validation, making it efficient and tamper-proof.

Moreover, compliance with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is a critical aspect of this solution. The DiGo Certify App is designed to adhere to GDPR principles, ensuring that personal data is protected while maintaining the integrity and transparency of academic records on the blockchain.
