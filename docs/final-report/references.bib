abstract = {Publisher Summary
Database archiving applications do not simply appear out of thin air. In reality a problem emerges for which database archiving is a solution. The problem comes first, followed by recognition of the problem; this then leads to a determination that database archiving is a solution to the problem. Finally, an effort to implement it emerges. Not all database applications have problems that lead to database archiving as a solution. The scope of those that do is usually restricted to a specific application or a specific unit of data within an application. An application usually belongs to a single business area. Database archiving is a business problem, and the responsibility usually belongs to the business unit. Database archiving does not generate new operational applications nor does it generate new data; it solves problems that emerge with existing or prior operational applications. The applications are already in place before database archiving is or can be implemented.}

abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger technology that has revolutionized businesses, industries, and commerce by eliminating the need for a central storage and control authority. Blockchain presents time-stamped and immutable blocks of data that are not owned by any single entity but rather managed by a group of nodes or computers where each block is secured and linked using cryptographic principles. The immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain has redefined trust, ownership, identity, and financial systems by providing a secure, fast, transparent, and pseudo-anonymous solution. This paper provides a comprehensive review of blockchain technology focusing on the historical background, underlying principles, and the sudden rise in the popularity of blockchain technology. The paper also discusses the various consensus algorithms of blockchain technology. Next, the paper focuses on the various application areas and prospective use cases of blockchain technology with the underlying challenges and issues. Further, the paper presents some unconventional use cases of blockchain technology. The study also reviews state-of-the-art articles to provide a comprehensive overview of the various aspects of blockchain technology in varied domains. The comparison between traditional database systems and blockchain technology is presented, and the appropriate scenarios where blockchain-based solutions may or may not provide the best solutions are also discussed. Further, it discusses some of the most infamous security breaches that impacted the blockchain industry in the recent past.}

ABSTRACT = {Blockchain is one of the latest technologies attracting increasing attention from different actors in diverse fields, including the educational sector. The objective of this study is to offer an overview of the current state of the art related to blockchain in education that may serve as a reference for future initiatives in this field. For this, a systematic review of reference journals was carried out. Eleven databases were systematically searched and eligible papers that focused on blockchain in education that made significant contributions, and not only generic statements about the topic, were selected. As a result, 28 articles were analyzed. Lack of precision, and selection and analysis bias were then minimized by involving three researchers. The analysis of the selected papers provided invaluable insight and answered the research questions posed about the current state of the application of blockchain in education, about which of its characteristics can benefit this sector, and about the challenges that must be addressed. Blockchain may become a relevant technology in the educational field, and therefore many proofs of concept are being developed. However, there are still some relevant technological, regulatory and academic issues to be addressed to pave the way for the mainstream adoption of this technology.},

ABSTRACT = {The issuance and verification of academic certificates face significant challenges in the digital era. The proliferation of counterfeit credentials and the lack of a reliable, universally accepted system for issuing and validating them pose critical issues in the educational domain. Certificates, traditionally issued by centralized educational institutions using their proprietary systems, pose challenges for straightforward verification, generating uncertainty about the credibility of academic achievements. In addition to diplomas issued by academic entities, it is now necessary in virtually all professional fields to stay updated and obtain accreditation for certain skills or experiences, which is a determining factor in securing or enhancing employment. Yet, there is no platform available to consistently demonstrate these capabilities and experiences. This article introduces a novel model for issuing and verifying academic information using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) supported by blockchain technologies, focused on compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It describes a model that grants control to the data subject, enabling the management of information access while adhering to key GDPR principles. Simultaneously, it remains compatible with existing systems within organizations, and is flexible in certifying various types of academic information. The implications of this model are discussed, emphasizing the importance of addressing privacy in blockchain-based applications.},

abstract = {Blockchain is considered a distributed ledger that can transact securely and trustfully without involving any third party. It has caused a lot of interest in various sectors, like government, finance, banking, etc. Blockchain technology is suitable for areas where multiple data storage and transaction types generally require the third party to authenticate the transactions involving transaction cost and authentication issues. In this paper, various aspects of Blockchain technology applications in public concern sectors have been analyzed in detail. This paper also reviews the multiple case studies and implementations of Blockchain technology in these sectors and their current status that provide a detailed insight into all the aspects of its application. This paper finally comes up with various implementation requirements in Government, Health, Finance, Economics, and Energy. Further, it identifies the challenges in successfully implementing Blockchain technology in these mentioned sectors to provide a reference for future deployments.}
