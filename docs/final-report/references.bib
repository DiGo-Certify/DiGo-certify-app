abstract = {Publisher Summary
Database archiving applications do not simply appear out of thin air. In reality a problem emerges for which database archiving is a solution. The problem comes first, followed by recognition of the problem; this then leads to a determination that database archiving is a solution to the problem. Finally, an effort to implement it emerges. Not all database applications have problems that lead to database archiving as a solution. The scope of those that do is usually restricted to a specific application or a specific unit of data within an application. An application usually belongs to a single business area. Database archiving is a business problem, and the responsibility usually belongs to the business unit. Database archiving does not generate new operational applications nor does it generate new data; it solves problems that emerge with existing or prior operational applications. The applications are already in place before database archiving is or can be implemented.}

abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger technology that has revolutionized businesses, industries, and commerce by eliminating the need for a central storage and control authority. Blockchain presents time-stamped and immutable blocks of data that are not owned by any single entity but rather managed by a group of nodes or computers where each block is secured and linked using cryptographic principles. The immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain has redefined trust, ownership, identity, and financial systems by providing a secure, fast, transparent, and pseudo-anonymous solution. This paper provides a comprehensive review of blockchain technology focusing on the historical background, underlying principles, and the sudden rise in the popularity of blockchain technology. The paper also discusses the various consensus algorithms of blockchain technology. Next, the paper focuses on the various application areas and prospective use cases of blockchain technology with the underlying challenges and issues. Further, the paper presents some unconventional use cases of blockchain technology. The study also reviews state-of-the-art articles to provide a comprehensive overview of the various aspects of blockchain technology in varied domains. The comparison between traditional database systems and blockchain technology is presented, and the appropriate scenarios where blockchain-based solutions may or may not provide the best solutions are also discussed. Further, it discusses some of the most infamous security breaches that impacted the blockchain industry in the recent past.}

ABSTRACT = {Blockchain is one of the latest technologies attracting increasing attention from different actors in diverse fields, including the educational sector. The objective of this study is to offer an overview of the current state of the art related to blockchain in education that may serve as a reference for future initiatives in this field. For this, a systematic review of reference journals was carried out. Eleven databases were systematically searched and eligible papers that focused on blockchain in education that made significant contributions, and not only generic statements about the topic, were selected. As a result, 28 articles were analyzed. Lack of precision, and selection and analysis bias were then minimized by involving three researchers. The analysis of the selected papers provided invaluable insight and answered the research questions posed about the current state of the application of blockchain in education, about which of its characteristics can benefit this sector, and about the challenges that must be addressed. Blockchain may become a relevant technology in the educational field, and therefore many proofs of concept are being developed. However, there are still some relevant technological, regulatory and academic issues to be addressed to pave the way for the mainstream adoption of this technology.},

abstract = {This chapter introduces the underlying technology, known as blockchain, of famous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It starts by introducing the term blockchain, its analogies and characteristics. Topics like the history and benefits of blockchain over traditional technologies are discussed. It emphasizes the architecture of blockchain and various consensus mechanisms. The later part of this chapter explores types of blockchain and the blockchain technology stack. Various top blockchains used today are listed. It also explains various challenges of using blockchain such as energy consumption, scalability, and public perception, and it explores the different types of attacks upon blockchain. Various applications of blockchain followed by a number of use cases such as loans and cross-border payments using blockchain are explained. Finally, the importance of blockchain in the real world besides cryptocurrencies is detailed as well as future scope.}
