Database archiving applications do not simply appear out of thin air. In reality a problem emerges for which database archiving is a solution. The problem comes first, followed by recognition of the problem; this then leads to a determination that database archiving is a solution to the problem. Finally, an effort to implement it emerges. Not all database applications have problems that lead to database archiving as a solution. The scope of those that do is usually restricted to a specific application or a specific unit of data within an application. An application usually belongs to a single business area. Database archiving is a business problem, and the responsibility usually belongs to the business unit. Database archiving does not generate new operational applications nor does it generate new data; it solves problems that emerge with existing or prior operational applications. The applications are already in place before database archiving is or can be implemented.}
